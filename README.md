The Python files for our numerical analysis are stored in this repository. 

The 'Steady state values' file is used for our results in Tabel 2 in Appendix. 

The expressions for the variables in steady state in the different Figure files are all similar to the ones shown in the "Steady state values" file. 

Questions to the code can be sent to kbq655@econ.ku.dk
